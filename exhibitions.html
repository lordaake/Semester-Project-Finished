                        Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky
                        and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
                        constellations
                        and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to
                        travel by.

                        Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to
                        the latest
                        exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                        role in industry and beyond.

                        Visitors will be able to see, touch, and interact with some of the most advanced robots and AI
                        systems in the world, providing a hands-on understanding of how these technologies work and

                    <p class="exhibitiontext">
                        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where
                        do we
                        come from and how did we get here?
                        Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                        framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

                        Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our
                        time.

                        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                        becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for
                        the whole
                        planet.

                        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global
                        warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
                        contribute to a brighter future.

                    This exhibition will give children a chance to explore their creative side through hands-on art
                    activities, such as painting, drawing, and sculpting. Children can learn about different art
                    styles and techniques, and create their own works of art to take home.

                    The exhibition will feature a variety of materials, such as paints, markers, pencils, clay, and
                    more, allowing children to experiment with different media and techniques. Children will be
                    encouraged to try out new skills and techniques and to take risks in their artistic expression.

                    The World of Dinosaurs is an educational and interactive exhibition that transports children
                    back in time to the era of the dinosaurs. With life-size models, fossils, and hands-on displays,
                    children can learn about different dinosaur species and their habitats.

                    Visitors will have the chance to touch and inspect real fossils, learn about the various types
                    of dinosaurs that roamed the earth, and discover how they lived and hunted.
