An interactive online science museum for the community.

## Description

Community Science Museum is an engaging platform where users can explore various scientific exhibits and learn about the wonders of science in a fun and interactive way.

- Dive into the fascinating world of science.
- Explore interactive exhibits.
- Learn through hands-on experiences.

Community Science Museum is an exciting project that began with creating a Figma prototype for a youth-oriented museum website. The unique approach was to design the mobile version first, which presented challenges but provided valuable insights. Building the desktop version and ensuring responsive design was another learning curve, especially optimizing box widths for different screen sizes.

The project aimed to transform the Figma prototype into a functional website that would cater to a young audience interested in science and discovery. Key features include:

A mobile-first design approach.
Responsive design for various screen sizes.
Conversion of images to 8-bit for smaller file sizes.
Hosting on Netlify via GitHub.
